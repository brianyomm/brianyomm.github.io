                    <h3>Ignite your Renaissance</h3>
                    <p>I was part of an early-stage startup formally called Patron, now <a href="https://www.musae.me/" target="_blank" class="a-dark text-red strike" >Musae</a>.  Our vision was to build a platform for creatives and patrons to discover, network, and book other creative professionals. In short, we offer free business tools to help creatives save time, make money, and acquire fresh new clients.</p>
                    <p>As one of the founding members I was required to wear many hats as possible. I coordinated and led all facets of design including: user task flows, visual, product, prototyping, and even the pitch deck.  I also conducted user research by interviews and surveys.</p>
                    <p>The Patron organization was truely amazing despite the fact the team worked remotely across the globe.  We were artists, engineers, musicians, designers, writers, hackers, and makers who came together with one mission.  We applied Agile methodology and tasks were tracked and assigned using Asana task management tool.</p>

                    <h3>Challenges</h3>
                    <p>This being my first UI/UX role there were many things that needed to be self-taught.  In retrospect, having a industrial design background helped.  The entire process was the similar when comparing ID and UI/UX.  From research, ideation, concepts, prototyping, and testing. Being one of the founding members, there were no guidelines or direct path for me to take. I considered this a plus since I enjoy experimentation and failing to move forward.</p>
                    <p>The product itself had alot of difficulties to overcome. For starters, we were located all around the globe who had full-time jobs. Overcoming time differences and setting a schedule that suited everyone was more difficult than anticipated.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Designing for two user types 'Creatives' and 'Patrons' was by far the biggest challenege. Where to draw the line would only be achieved by testing. But with no user-base, we relied on competitive analysis.</p>
                    <h3>Goals</h3>
                    <ul class="list margin">
                        <li><p>1. Formulating a design language and choosing the right tools.</p></li>
                        <li><p>2. Design a homepage for both Creatives and Patron with curated creative content.</p></li>
                        <li><p>3. Design a signup process that caters to both Creatives and Patrons.</p></li>
                        <li><p>4. Design Creative & Patron Profiles where users can curate a portfolio, display a bio, show off their creative service, read reviews about the creative.</p></li>
                        <li><p>5. Design a dashboard that allows user's to have full control over settings, add creative services, booking features, and reviews.</p></li>
                        <li><p>6. Growth hacking with 0 budget using social media and scraping tools.</p></li>
                        <li><p>7. User testing our platform for insight.</p></li>
                        <li><p>8. Rinse & repeat.</p></li>
                        <li><p>9. Create a pitch deck to obtain dough to pay for caffiene + beer.</p></li>

                    <h3>foundation + Tools</h3>
                    <p>There were a couple of design related items that needed work. One major one being was a lack of design language. So a decision was made to define our design language by adopting <a href="https://material.io/guidelines/" target="_blank" class="text-green strike">Angular Material</a> to achieve a simple but proven design library. From breakpoints to element placements, everything was previously tested for optimal usability.</p>
                    <p>During the early stages wireframes were designed in Adobe Illustrator and UXPin... So I suggested we start using Sketch. Nightmares were averted and countless hours were saved after I created our design library in Sketch. Adding uniform elements with a simple copy/paste sure as hell beat rebuilding in Illustrator. With right tools we proceeded to move forward.</p>

                    <h3>Research & Analysis</h3>
                    <p>We did not have a direct competitor but there were other platforms that essentially had similar features. A few of them being Airbnb, Taskrabbit, Patreon, Ello, and Twitch. We collected designs on how each platform introduced each feature to their audience and how they balanced the two user cases on a single page.  We learned that in most cases the main site caters towards the Patron (in our case) to able to consume the content.  And a separate page that explains how the platform works for content creators.  This way the Patron will be delighted by services provided by Creatives, and the Creatives will be inspired by other Creatives.</p>
                    <p>In terms of design, AngularJS provides an excellent UI framework based on Google Material Design.  With this extensive library, we are able to tailor each module to our liking. Then we compared our modules with existing designs and made adjustments if necessary</p>

                    <h3>Identity</h3>
                    <p>Our previous logo was clearly an afterthought shadowed by the development of the site. So I pushed the importance of a truely unique logo.  Creative content is a personal experience for everyone, from artists creating it all the way to Patrons admiring it.  We wanted to capture the essence of the arts by being a blank canvas to be dynamic.  This way we are able to incorporate other forms, colors, and patterns to work in tandem with other creative content.</p>

                    <p>Looking at the existing design of the profile page, it was clear that I needed to inject our design language for optimum legibility.  The centered profile image provides balance, however in mobile it will cause issues.  So ultimately I shifted it over to the left to provide ample room for user name and location.</p>

                    <p>We had two key requirements we wanted to incorporate to differentiate ourselves compared to other platforms. One was to allow users to upload videos as their cover media.  A simple youtube link inserted into the profile settings, will allow users to make their page truly unique.</p>

After looking back at our user stories we populated questions that added up to a 20 minute test. on Google Forms.

                    <h3>Startup Experience</h3>
                    <p>Reflecting back to my time at Patron, I have experienced the rapid advancement of my design abilities. It was very rewarding to be able to tap into my various design skills from graphic, web, and video editing.  You have to be a team player, working with devs to break down your designs, explaining the importance of the 60 character count for optimal legibility to the CEO. It was all hands on deck almost all the time.  One thing I am most proud of was learning how to facilitate the company define a design language and product so it no longer was just UX Pin screenshots.</p>
                    <p>One of many notable skills I picked up was self-learning.  Figuring things out as you go along, by reading design blogs on Medium, and diving into Stack Overflow.  It really is a skill to be able to ask Google the right questions.</p>
                    <p>Trusting your instincts based on qualitative research was another one.  Risk taking is great, but sometimes overstepping out of your comfort zone might do more harm than good.  Taking that risky idea and exploring why it might be the right solution was key to build successful features.</p>
                    <p>I learnt the granular complexities that go into designing a product/feature from scratch and how integral the role of a UI/UX designer is within the team.</p>
                    <p>Things I would do differently next time?  Join a mid-stage startup so I can get paid ;)</p>
