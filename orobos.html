                    <p>After college, I was lost.  To control the situation, I embarked on a soul searching journey.  Searching for an explanation or a visual representation that best reflected my current state.  I turned to the rabbit hole of Pinterest, where I came across the image below.</p>

                    <p>In Korean culture we adopted the Chinese zodiac animals deriving from our birth years.  Mine being the snake, I was naturally attracted to anything snake related.  The symbol represented Ouroboros. An ancient Egyptian and Greek symbol that has the literal translation of "tail eater".  There are several meanings interwoven into it.  Few of them being the cyclic nature of the universe: creation out of destruction, life out of death.  An eternal cycle of renewal.</p>
                    <p>If there is a beginning there is an end.  If there is an end there is a beginning.  Through the journey we call life, it is inevitable to avoid failure.  Through failure, lessons will be taught and we strive to begin again where we left off.  I saw it as an infinite cycle until we part this world.  This idea helped me move past my insecurities and motivated me to create an apparel brand called Orobos, short for ouroboros.  This was a personal project that I held very close to me.</p>

                    <p>I was working for a e-comm company where we specialized in phone cases.  My boss originally being in the textile industry had garments and samples laying around everywhere.  Curious, I asked him about it.  He was interested in starting a clothing line and asked if I was interested.  I pitched my idea for a performance athleisure brand using highly technical fabrics.  He was willing to invest!  Coincidently, my father was in the textile industry so I was always interested in apparel.  I figured this was a great opportunity to learn and expand my design knowledge.  We scraped the phone cases and gave birth to an apparel company.  I immediately knew Orobos would make the perfect brand name and I already had a logo.</p>

                    <p>I sought inspiration from watching numerous interviews of established designers in the space. One designer that stood out was Alexander Wang.  The rise of athleisure was happening during this time and Wang created daring pieces marrying handbags and Jordan shoes.  Accompanied by one piece dresses that were made in highly technical fabrics.  I was searching the right direction.</p>

                    <p>The biggest hurdle was coming up with a business plan.  Since everything was new to me.  Google was my best friend and reaching out to a small networks of friends who were in the apparel industry gave me some guidance.</p>
                    <p>Learning how to create tech packs was a familiar experience since it was created in illustrator.  However spec-ing out the details was a new challenge.</p>

                    <p>In industrial design choosing the right materials for a product is just as important as the product itself.  The same was for apparel.  Each fabric has a different sensation on the skin, way it drapes, reflects light, the list is endless.  The only way to understand these qualities of fabrics was to go through racks and racks of different textiles.  Luckily my boss had those racks and sample packs.  Touch being the favorite of my senses, it was quite addicting to feel all the fabrics.</p>
                    <p>With performance wear in mind I was able to narrow down given that heat retention, sweat wicking, and weatherproofing were key factors.  Nylon, elastic + cotton blends, and neoprene were primarily used.</p>
