                    <p>After college, I was lost.  To control the situation, I embarked on a soul searching journey.  Searching for an explanation or a visual representation that best reflected my current state.  I turned to the rabbit hole of Pinterest, where I came across the image below.</p>

                    <p>In Korean culture we adopted the Chinese zodiac animals deriving from our birth years.  Mine being the snake, I was naturally attracted to anything snake related.  The symbol represented Ouroboros. An ancient Egyptian and Greek symbol that has the literal translation of "tail eater".  There are several meanings interwoven into it.  Few of them being the cyclic nature of the universe: creation out of destruction, life out of death.  An eternal cycle of renewal.</p>
                    <p>If there is a beginning there is an end.  If there is an end there is a beginning.  Through the journey we call life, it is inevitable to avoid failure.  Through failure, lessons will be taught and we strive to begin again where we left off.  I saw it as an infinite cycle until we part this world.  This idea helped me move past my insecurities and motivated me to create an apparel brand called Orobos, short for ouroboros.  This was a personal project that I held very close to me.</p>

                    <p>I was working for a e-comm company where we specialized in phone cases.  My boss originally being in the textile industry had garments and samples laying around everywhere.  Curious, I asked him about it.  He was interested in starting a clothing line and asked if I was interested.  I pitched my idea for a performance athleisure brand using highly technical fabrics.  He was willing to invest!  Coincidently, my father was in the textile industry so I was always interested in apparel.  I figured this was a great opportunity to learn and expand my design knowledge.  We scraped the phone cases and gave birth to an apparel company.  I immediately knew Orobos would make the perfect brand name and I already had a logo.</p>

                    <p>I sought inspiration from watching numerous interviews of established designers in the space. One designer that stood out was Alexander Wang.  The rise of athleisure was happening during this time and Wang created daring pieces marrying handbags and Jordan shoes.  Accompanied by one piece dresses that were made in highly technical fabrics.  I was searching the right direction.</p>

                    <p>The biggest hurdle was coming up with a business plan.  Since everything was new to me.  Google was my best friend and reaching out to a small networks of friends who were in the apparel industry gave me some guidance.</p>
                    <p>Learning how to create tech packs was a familiar experience since it was created in illustrator.  However spec-ing out the details was a new challenge.</p>

                    <p>In industrial design choosing the right materials for a product is just as important as the product itself.  The same was for apparel.  Each fabric has a different sensation on the skin, way it drapes, reflects light, the list is endless.  The only way to understand these qualities of fabrics was to go through racks and racks of different textiles.  Luckily my boss had those racks and sample packs.  Touch being the favorite of my senses, it was quite addicting to feel all the fabrics.</p>
                    <p>With performance wear in mind I was able to narrow down given that heat retention, sweat wicking, and weatherproofing were key factors.  Nylon, elastic + cotton blends, and neoprene were primarily used.</p>

                <p>It has been a fantastic learning experience and journey designing and developing SoJo's site.  With over 500 daily visitors it was very rewarding to say the least.  And during the course of 2017 it was humbling to hear the positive comments towards the initial site.  Little did they know the site was temporary.</p>
                <p>As a result of this experience, I learned how to design and develop a commercial website.  From optimizing images to code, the project allowed me to flex my multidisciplinary design background. Initially I thought to myself how easy I had it since I was the designer and developer, but boy I was wrong.  Having a stronger background in design I defaulted in exploring more complex designs which ended up being hurdles during development.   Finding the balance of what was possible without the input of a developer was challenging.  The solution was to tame the perfectionist in me to progress in code.  Building out the structure then dressing it up with style elements was key to completing the project in time.  Granted, some of the pages was not my best work, but since the site was temporary, improvements were made down the road.</p>

                    <p>After using the site for over a year since its completion, my colleagues and I realized the shortcomings of the CMS platform.  Pain points started to become more clear.  Copy edits  for non-developers was a huge one.  The CMS platform had a very small input field for the code.  This meant selecting the code > select all > cut > paste into a text editor > edit > paste into CMS > save > open up the page with a CMS unique URL to publish content.   We were lucky the copywriter was familiar with code to make those changes off CMS.</p>
                    <p>We all thought it would be more optimal to have a central interface to make edits.  WordPress was the solution.  Easy to scale, Azure compatible, and a expansive plugin library and customization options.  Once again I had zero knowledge in WordPress and a new venture began.  Learning never stops!</p>
