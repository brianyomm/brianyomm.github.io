                    <p>I've had the pleasure and honor to design and develope SoJo Spa Club's commercial website from scratch.  This project is a two part case study encompassing the initial temporary site and the final WordPress site.  I was the sole designer and developer for both sites.</p>
                    <p>Before being commissioned, there was an existing site that was built on a custom CMS platform provided by Navy Zebra a payment processing company.  The CMS platform allowed developement to be built on the Bootstrap Framework, luckily I learned web developement with Bootstrap so I'd thought it would be a breeze.  Those unfamiliar with Bootstrap: it is a highly praised CSS library built using a 12 column rule which can be easily modified with a myriad of classes.</p>
                    <h3 class="text-brown">Fake it till you make it</h3>
                    <p>First and foremost, let me come out clean and explain that I am not a developer by trade.  However, I have built personal projects in the past.  With a basic knowledge of development I dove straight into the deep-end. RIP</p>

                    <h3 class="text-brown">Challenges</h3>
                    <p>This project was one of the biggest challenges I faced in my career.  A fully functioning site containing 25 pages was to be built in 2 weeks, before the grand opening of the facility.  No pressure!  The excitement of working on such a large project with a large audience made me believe it was all possible.</p>
                    <p>The first challenge was setting up the environment.  I had to familiarize myself with working with Navy Zebra's CMS platform which could only be accessed on approved devices.  I was given a Windows laptop with access, but who wants to develop on a PC... So I carried two machines during the project, a Mac & PC.  Assets were uploaded via FTP using FileZilla onto the Microsoft Azure server.  And code was published through Navy Zebra's CMS software.   This was foreign to me since I have never worked with a CMS platform.</p>
                </div>

            <!-- Insert CMS -->
            <div class="container container-wide">
                <div class="work-logo-green work-element">

            <div class="container container-base">
                <div id="work-intro2" class="work-element">
                    <p>Secondly, designing a pleasing site that could be quickly developed within the strict time restraint was quite the challenge.  Initially I thought it was great having both roles, but afterwards I really appreciated working with devs and how their insight could set design boundaries.</p>
                    <p>The third challenge was the image assets.  They were mediocre to say the least.  The perfectionist in me was hoping to be working with beautiful proportionate assets.   But structuring the site was more important at this point.</p>
                    <p>SoJo Spa Club being a staple in luxury spas I was challenged to design a site that reflected a destination of such magnitude.  Pleasing patrons before, after, and during their visit was quite a task.  On top of that, designing for a unique audience who have little to no knowledge of a Korean Bathhouse was the biggest challenge.  Luckily, I had the pleasure of working with the one Graphic Designer who was also a fellow RISD Alumni.  She designed the signs and prints which set a great foundation for me to work with.</p>
                    <p>Again, time was NOT on my side. (Probably never have been...)</p>

                    <p>It all began with finding inspiration on my favorite resource, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/brianyom/web/" class="text-brown strike" target="_blank">Pinterest</a>.  Over the past 4 years, I have curated the latest web design trends on Pinterest.  From my previous findings I filtered down a couple of designs worth building.   Afterwards asked the client for feedback on my findings to move forward with lo-fi mockups.</p>

                    <p>Since this was a informative website showcasing features of the SoJo, the UX aspect was straightforward.  Each page offered information about each amenities and admission/facility information, sometimes accompanied by CTAs to book spa treatment services or to display more information.</p>

I gave myself a 20 hour per day work schedule.  Which gave me approximately 10 hours to build a single page.  Within those 10 hours I allocated some time to edit CSS and photos.  Caffeine was my best friend and sleep was my enemy.</p>
                    <p>For copy, SoJo outsourced a marketing agency that provided me with a word document.  Image assets were taking by an amateur photographer... So I was required to enhance, resize, crop, and optimize each asset.</p>

                    <p>After 222 hours, 4 gallons of coffee, and 134 emails later, the site was operational.  How did I do it?  I had an ace up my sleeve.  An extensive mix & mash CSS library from previous projects which I re-purposed for this project.  Without it I wouldn't have accepted the project.</p>

                <h3 class="text-brown">Takeaway</h3>
                <p>It has been a fantastic learning experience and journey designing and developing SoJo's site.  With over 500 daily visitors it was very rewarding to say the least.  And during the course of 2017 it was humbling to hear the positive comments towards the initial site.  Little did they know the site was temporary.</p>
                <p>As a result of this experience, I learned how to design and develop a commercial website.  From optimizing images to code, the project allowed me to flex my multidisciplinary design background. Initially I thought to myself how easy I had it since I was the designer and developer, but boy I was wrong.  Having a stronger background in design I defaulted in exploring more complex designs which ended up being hurdles during development.   Finding the balance of what was possible without the input of a developer was challenging.  The solution was to tame the perfectionist in me to progress in code.  Building out the structure then dressing it up with style elements was key to completing the project in time.  Granted, some of the pages was not my best work, but since the site was temporary, improvements were made down the road.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-blue">WordPress</h3>
                    <p>After using the site for over a year since its completion, my colleagues and I realized the shortcomings of the CMS platform.  Pain points started to become more clear.  Copy edits  for non-developers was a huge one.  The CMS platform had a very small input field for the code.  This meant selecting the code > select all > cut > paste into a text editor > edit > paste into CMS > save > open up the page with a CMS unique URL to publish content.   We were lucky the copywriter was familiar with code to make those changes off CMS.</p>
                    <p>We all thought it would be more optimal to have a central interface to make edits.  WordPress was the solution.  Easy to scale, Azure compatible, and a expansive plugin library and customization options.  Once again I had zero knowledge in WordPress and a new venture began.  Learning never stops!</p>
